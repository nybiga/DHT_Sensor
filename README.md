# DHT Sensor

This project uses PlatformIO as it's ecosystem.
It uses a DHT sensor to detect the humidity and temperature in the environment every second until the circuit has no power.

## Tools used

An Arduino board
Breadboard
Jumper wires(3)

## Library used

DHT sensor library@^1.4.6 by adafruit

## Design

See DHT11_circuit.png for circuit design. This image was gotten from https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/interfacing-dht11-sensor-with-arduino .

## Physical appearance

See DHT11.jpg for physical appearance.
See DHT11.MP4 for to see how it works.
